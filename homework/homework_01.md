Finding an interesting paper
Homework #1
FISH 521 - Proposal Writing and Professional Development

3 January 2022



Task 1
Use some form of database search engine (or word of mouth) to find a scientific (focal) paper of interest that was published in 2016 or earlier. Provide the complete citation for the paper.

George Roff, Christopher Doropoulos, Alice Rogers, Yves-Marie Bozec, Nils C. Krueck, Eleanor 
Aurellado, Mark Priest, Chico Birrell, Peter J. Mumby, The Ecological Role of Sharks on Coral Reefs, Trends in Ecology & Evolution, Volume 31, Issue 5, 2016, Pages 395-407, ISSN 0169-5347, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2016.02.014.


Task 2
Write down 3 things you like about the paper and 3 things you would have done differently (eg, less technical language, writing style, layout/organization, use of tables and figures, design of tables or figures).

First, I like how the paper isn’t too technical, yet the paper still portrays the subject with science appropriate language. The paper is factual and informative; however, it is also readable and someone with a minute science background (or understanding of shark ecological function, etc) would still comprehend the article. Second, the flow of the article is also quite nice. There weren’t many sections that felt wordy or that dragged on. This paper was clear and concise and seldom moved away from main points. Lastly, circling back to being reader friendly, the tables and graphs used in this article are also easy to understand. I think often researchers get too specific with their graphs to a point where unless you were a stats major, you would have no idea how to make sense of an overcomplicated figure. 

Ultimately, this was a well-written article. The author had a clear pathway in how they wanted to share their study and stuck to it. Also, they allowed this paper to be palatable across scientific knowledge levels. 

Task 3
Provide the citations for 5 papers that your focal paper cited that you are interested in reading and learning more about.

1.	Predicting ecological consequences of marine top predator declines, by Heithaus et al. (2007) 
2.	Omnivory as a stabilizing feature of natural communities, by Fagan (1997)
3.	Interaction strength combinations and the overfishing of a marine food web, by Bascompte et al. (2005)
4.	Tropic interactions at the top of the coral reef food chain, by Mourier et al. (2013)
5.	Caught in the middle: Combined impacts of shark removal and coral loss on the fish communities of coral reefs, by Ruppert et al. (2013)



Taks 4
Provide the citations for 5 papers that cited your focal paper and that you are interested in reading and learning more about. (Note: if your focal paper has not yet been cited 5+ times, indicate as much and list all of those that have cited it.)
